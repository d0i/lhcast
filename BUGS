- lhjoin currently only supports single segment
  (should handle multiple segments -- sequential or parallel)
- SHA1 sum is not yet used (in segment header)
- I use last 3 bytes as segment index of a file -- is this good?
- sending/receiving over wlan seems not working well -- maybe I need to consider some network buffers (some buffer overflow?)
